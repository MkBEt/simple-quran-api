{"aya":"040","id":2831,"locale":"en","sura":"024","text":"Or [they are] like darknesses within an unfathomable sea which is covered by waves, upon which are waves, over which are clouds - darknesses, some of them upon others. When one puts out his hand [therein], he can hardly see it. And he to whom Allah has not granted light - for him there is no light.","translator":"Saheeh International"}

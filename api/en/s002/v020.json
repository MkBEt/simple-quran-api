{"aya":"020","id":27,"locale":"en","sura":"002","text":"The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Every time it lights [the way] for them, they walk therein; but when darkness comes over them, they stand [still]. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.","translator":"Saheeh International"}
